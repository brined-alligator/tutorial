# My First Blog Post

Published on: 03/09/2025\

Welcome to my first blog post.

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning astro (yippee!) here I will share my progress as I build ts and will add infinite money glitch to it


## What I did so far
1. **installing astro**: i installed astro and node.js.
2. **creating new project**: i used create Astro@latest to create new astro template.
3. **making new pages**: i learnt how to add new pages to my own wbesiet and add buttons to navigate between them.
4. **making first blog post**: i made this log post you are reading. i do not know where you live. your tears are filled with salt.


Let me tell you something: I do not like war crimes, but that does not mean I hate it. It's not fun... enough.
