## The problem

As I add more posts to the blog page, it becomes annoying to append a new item and `im lazy`.

## The solution

so I'm going to fix that by creating a variable called `allPosts` in blog.astro that uses a weird algorithm like a for loop and creates these posts so I don't have to.
In other words, `allPosts` uses the values `import.meta.glob('posts./*.md')` (pretty cool huh?) that looks in the posts folder using the asterisk to search for any files with the `.md` extension. `Which is, pretty neat`.
